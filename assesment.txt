Backend Task 1: Real-time Data Aggregation Service
Problem Statement
Build a service that aggregates real-time meme coin data from multiple DEX sources with efficient caching and real-time updates. The service should handle the same data flow you see in axiom.trade's discover page - where tokens are fetched, merged, and updated live.
Available Free APIs
You can use these real APIs instead of mocking:
DexScreener API: https://api.dexscreener.com/latest/dex/tokens/{tokenAddress} or /latest/dex/search?q={query}
Jupiter Price API: https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v2/search?query=SOL
GeckoTerminal API: https://docs.coingecko.com/docs/setting-up-your-api-key
Note: Some have rate limits (300 requests/min for DexScreener). Plan accordingly.
Core Requirements
Data Aggregation


Fetch token data from at least 2 real DEX APIs
Handle rate limiting with exponential backoff
Merge duplicate tokens intelligently (same token might appear on multiple DEXs)
Implement caching (configurable TTL, default 30 s) to reduce API calls

Real-time Updates


Implement WebSocket support for live price updates
Push updates for price changes, volume spikes
Handle the pattern shown in the network tab - initial data load followed by WebSocket updates as mentioned in technical context

Filtering & Sorting


Support filtering by time periods (1h, 24h, 7d)
Sort by various metrics (volume, price change, market cap)
Support cursor-based pagination (limit/next-cursor) for large token lists
Suggested Tech Stack
Runtime: Node.js with TypeScript
Web Framework: Express.js or Fastify
WebSocket: Socket.io or native ws library
Cache: Redis (with ioredis client)
HTTP Client: Axios with retry logic or got
Task Scheduling: node-cron or Bull queue
Reference: https://axiom.trade/discover
Technical Context
The frontend shows 20-30 tokens per page
After initial load, updates come through WebSocket (no new HTTP calls when filtering)
Multiple data sources need to be aggregated in real-time
Focus on data freshness and update efficiency
Sample Token Data Structure
{
  "token_address": "576P1t7XsRL4ZVj38LV2eYWxXRPguBADA8BxcNz1xo8y",
  "token_name": "PIPE CTO",
  "token_ticker": "PIPE",
  "price_sol": 4.4141209798877615e-7,
  "market_cap_sol": 441.41209798877617,
  "volume_sol": 1322.4350391679925,
  "liquidity_sol": 149.359428555,
  "transaction_count": 2205,
  "price_1hr_change": 120.61,
  "protocol": "Raydium CLMM"
}


What NOT to Focus On
Authentication/authorization
Blockchain interaction
Complex token analysis
Historical data persistence
Evaluation Criteria
Architecture design and scalability approach
Handling of real-time data and WebSocket implementation
Caching strategy and performance optimization
Error handling and recovery mechanisms
Code quality and best practices
Understanding of distributed system challenges
Deliverables
GitHub repo with clean commits for working service with REST API and WebSocket server
Deploy to free hosting - include public URL in README
Link to GitHub docs/readme with basic documentation explaining design decisions
1-2 min public youtube video link that shows functionality
API working with live demo
Multiple browser tabs showing WebSocket updates
Making 5-10 rapid API calls showing response times
Request flow through your system and design decisions
Postman/Insomnia collection and  ≥ 10 unit/integration tests covering happy-path & edge-cases
Please note all three deliverables are required, we’ll consider the application incomplete if any of the deliverables are missing.
